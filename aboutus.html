        <h1>About Us: Stronger Together</h1><br>
        <h2>Our Story</h2><br>
        <p>It didn’t start in a high-end gym with bright lights and expensive machines. It started right here, in the heart of our home. We realized that as life got busier, the first thing to get pushed aside was our health. We wanted a way to stay active that didn't take us away from our family—but instead, brought us together.</p><br>
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2><br>
        <p>We believe that fitness shouldn't be a chore or a "solo mission." Whether it’s a quick set of pushups before dinner or a family squat challenge in the living room, health is a lifestyle we build together.</p><br>
        <h2>We focus on three things:</h2><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Accessibility:</b> No gym membership? No problem. Your living room is your arena.</li>
          <li><b>Consistency:</b> We value $1\%$ progress every day over a perfect workout once a month.</li>
          <li><b>Legacy:</b> We aren't just getting fit for ourselves; we’re teaching the next generation that movement is a gift.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Why Choose the Fitness Family?</h2><br>
        <p>Most fitness programs are designed for individuals. We design for real life. We know that sometimes a toddler will crawl under you while you're doing planks, and sometimes "home-work" actually means working out at home.</p><br>
        <p>Whether you are a parent trying to reclaim your energy or a family looking to bond through movement, you’ve found your squad.</p><br><br>
        <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;"><strong><q>A family that sweats together, stays together.</q></strong></p><br>
